Shishijee mli lɛ Nyɔŋmɔ bɔ ŋwɛi kɛ shikpɔŋ.	In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth.
Ni shikpɔŋ lɛ yɛ olɛŋlɛ, ni efee flóŋŋ, ni duŋ ha nu babaoo ni ha shikpɔŋ lɛ nɔ lɛ hiɛ; ni Nyɔŋmɔ Mumɔ lɛ ha nu lɛ hiɛ.	The earth was without form and void, and darkness was over the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God was hovering over the face of the waters.
Ni Nyɔŋmɔ fa akɛ, “La aba.” Kɛkɛ ni la ba.	And God said, “Let there be light,” and there was light.
Ni Nyɔŋmɔ na akɛ la lɛ hi.	And God saw that the light was good.
Ni Nyɔŋmɔ gbala la lɛ kɛ duŋ lɛ mli.	And God separated the light from the darkness.
Nyɔŋmɔ tsɛ la lɛ shwane, ni duŋ lɛ etsɛ lɛ nyɔɔŋ.	God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. 
Je na, ni je tsɛre, ni no ji klɛŋklɛŋ gbi lɛ.	And there was evening and there was morning, the first day.
Kɛkɛ ni Nyɔŋmɔ fa akɛ, “Atatu aba koni eja nu lɛ mli enyɔ.”	And God said, “Let there be an expanse in the midst of the waters, and let it separate the waters from the waters.”
No hewɔ lɛ, Nyɔŋmɔ fee atatu lɛ ni eja nu lɛ mli enyɔ koni ana nu yɛ atatu lɛ shishi ni ana nu yɛ atatu lɛ yiteŋ	And God made the expanse and separated the waters that were under the expanse from the waters that were above the expanse.
ni eba mli nakai.	 And it was so.
Nyɔŋmɔ tsɛ he ni atatu lɛ yɔɔ lɛ akɛ ŋwɛi. Je na, ni je tsɛre; no ji gbi ni ji enyɔ lɛ.	And God called the expanse Heaven. And there was evening and there was morning, the second day.
Kɛkɛ ni Nyɔŋmɔ fa akɛ, “Nu ni yɔɔ ŋwɛishishi lɛ abua ehe naa yɛ he kome, koni ana shikpɔŋ gbiŋ lɛ!”.	And God said, “Let the waters under the heavens be gathered together into one place, and let the dry land appear.”
Nyɔŋmɔ tsɛ he ni egbi lɛ akɛ shikpɔŋ, ni nu ni ebua ehe naa lɛ etsɛ lɛ ŋshɔ	God called the dry land Earth, and the waters that were gathered together he called Seas.
ni Nyɔŋmɔ na akɛ ehi.	And God saw that it was good.
Kɛkɛ ni Nyɔŋmɔ fa akɛ, “Shikpɔŋ lɛ akwɛ̃ bai kɛ tsei kɛ jwɛi; tsei ni woɔ yibii ni wui yɔɔ mli, kɛ yeli tsei ni woɔ yibii ni wui yɔɔ mli, eko fɛɛ eko lɛ yɛ ehenɔ yɛ shikpɔŋ lɛ nɔ!”	And God said, “Let the earth sprout vegetation, plants yielding seed, and fruit trees bearing fruit in which is their seed, each according to its kind, on the earth.”
Shikpɔŋ lɛ kwɛ̃ tsei kɛ bai kɛ jwɛi; tsei ni woɔ yibii ni wui yɔɔ mli, kɛ yeli tsei ni woɔ yibii ni wui yɔɔ mli, eko fɛɛ eko kɛ ehenɔ yɛ shikpɔŋ lɛ nɔ.	The earth brought forth vegetation, plants yielding seed according to their own kinds, and trees bearing fruit in which is their seed, each according to its kind.
Ni je na, ni je tsɛre; ni no fee gbi ni ji etɛ̃ lɛ.	And there was evening and there was morning, the third day.
Kɛkɛ ni Nyɔŋmɔ fa akɛ, “Kanei aba ŋwɛi atatu lɛ mli koni amɛtsɔɔ shwane kɛ nyɔɔŋ teŋ srɔto ni amɛtsɔɔ okadii kɛ bei kɛ gbii kɛ afii	And God said, “Let there be lights in the expanse of the heavens to separate the day from the night. And let them be for signs and for seasons, and for days and years
ni amɛtsɔmɔ kanei yɛ ŋwɛi atatuiaŋ ni amɛtso yɛ shikpɔŋ lɛ nɔ.”	and let them be lights in the expanse of the heavens to give light upon the earth.”
Nyɔŋmɔ bɔ kanei wuji enyɔ lɛ koni ewulu lɛ aye shwane nɔ ni bibioo lɛ aye nyɔɔŋ nɔ, ni ebɔ ŋulamii lɛ hu.	God made the two great lights—the greater light to rule the day and the lesser light to rule the night—and the stars.
Nyɔŋmɔ kɛ amɛ wo ŋwɛi atatu lɛ mli koni amɛtso yɛ shikpɔŋ lɛ nɔ	And God set them in the expanse of the heavens to give light on the earth
koni amɛye shwane kɛ nyɔɔŋ nɔ, ni amɛgbala la lɛ kɛ duŋ lɛ mli.	to rule over the day and over the night, and to separate the light from the darkness.
Nyɔŋmɔ na akɛ ehi.	God saw that it was good.
Ni je na ni je tsɛre ni no fee gbi ni ji ejwɛ lɛ.	And there was evening and there was morning, the fourth day.
Kɛkɛ ni Nyɔŋmɔ fa akɛ, “Nu lɛ awo loi nyɛŋɛnyɛŋɛ, ni loofɔji afliki yɛ ŋwɛi kɔɔyɔɔ lɛ mli!”	And God said, “Let the waters swarm with swarms of living creatures, and let birds fly above the earth across the expanse of the heavens.”
No hewɔ lɛ, Nyɔŋmɔ bɔ ŋshɔŋ loi wuji lɛ kɛ nɔ fɛɛ nɔ ni hiɛ ka ni tsiɔ ehe ni nu lɛ ewo nyɛŋɛnyɛŋɛ lɛ. Asaŋ ebɔ loofɔji fɛɛ yɛ amɛhenɔ.	So God created the great sea creatures and every living creature that moves, with which the waters swarm, according to their kinds, and every winged bird according to its kind.
Kɛkɛ ni Nyɔŋmɔ jɔɔ amɛ, ni ekɛɛ, “Nyɛfɔa koni nyɛyi afaa ni nyɛyimɔa fai kɛ ŋshɔ mli obɔbɔ, ni loofɔji afa yɛ shikpɔŋ lɛ nɔ!”	And God blessed them, saying, “Be fruitful and multiply and fill the waters in the seas, and let birds multiply on the earth.”
Ni je na ni je tsɛre, ni efee gbi ni ji enumɔ lɛ.	And there was evening and there was morning, the fifth day.
